tic-tac-toe
===========

A game of tic tac toe.
To play, run the tic.class with java tic
You can play with another person or against a computer.
The computer has three difficulties, easy, medium and hard.
This is a small weekend project I did, nothing too fancy. 

To play, run the python script compile.py (python compile.py) first. This will compile and launch the game. After it has compiled, you can run play,py to play without recompiling or run complile.py again.
Or you can compile each file and run java tic to run the program.
